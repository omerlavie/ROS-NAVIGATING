# ROS-NAVIGATING
A ROS program written in Python for navigating from a given source point to a given destination point while avoiding obstacles on the grid. The algorithm used for navigation is Bug 2 (all of the turns in this code are to the right).
For more information about the Bug 2 algorithm: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/lecture/Chap2-Bug-Alg_howie.pdf

## Running the program
In order to set the destination point that the turtlebot should navigate to, change the goal_x and goal_y values in the coverage/coverage.launch xml file.
